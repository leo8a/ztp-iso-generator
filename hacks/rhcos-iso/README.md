# How to use this repo

The purpose of this set of scripts is to create a minimal ISO suitable for booting a minimal RHCOS, and then download the rootfs and ignition from remote endpoints.

To achieve that, please execute the following steps:

1. Execute `00_generate_rhcos_iso.sh` - This will create a small ISO, based on `syslinux`, with the contents from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.9/latest/ 
(live-initramfs and live-kernel). It will place the final iso on `/tmp/coreos.iso` path.

2. In order to customize the image, please execute `inject_config_files.sh`. It takes the following parameters:

- original ISO to configure
- final ISO path
- ignition_path
- rootfs path
- kernel arguments
- extra config folder

> Kernel arguments and config folder are optional, you can skip just by passing a blank value "" into the position of these parameters.

This script will take the original ISO and will inject the needed parameters in the kernel arguments, in order to configure the network with the given settings, and then downloading rootfs and ignition from remote urls. It will also take the extra config folder that you specify, and inject it into the ramdisk, allowing to configure network, run additional services, etc.

> After rootfs has been mounted, the specified ignition will run, allowing to customize the image in the usual way.

### Usage samples:

**For kernel arguments:**
```shell
./rhcos-iso/inject_config_files.sh /tmp/coreos.iso /tmp/final_coreos.iso http://192.168.111.1:8080/ignition_url http://192.168.111.1:8080/rootfs.img "ip=192.168.111.20::192.168.111.200:255.255.255.0:cluster.local:eno2:on:8.8.8.8"
```

**For extra ramdisk:**
```shell
./rhcos-iso/inject_config_files.sh /tmp/coreos.iso /tmp/final_coreos.iso http://192.168.111.1:8080/ignition_url http://192.168.111.1:8080/rootfs.img "" /path/to/config_folder
```

In the config folder, you need to create a filesystem that will replicate the folder structure that you want to see on the ramdisk. For example:

```
/tmp/network_config/
└── etc
    └── NetworkManager
        └── system-connections
            └── eno1.nmconnection
```

Will copy the file to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/eno1.nmconnection`, if you specify `/tmp/network_config` as the config folder

> The files placed on this config folder will change their ownership to root. But it's still important that you give the right permissions to all the folders and files inside this structure.
